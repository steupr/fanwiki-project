I added the healing process for completeness and because I thought that's what you had in mind. :) I'm more the one to look over something and (trying to) check for typos and missing references as for I'm not native English. But I see if one article is not consistent in tense for example. :) But you surely don't have to apologize at my place.

It always sounds right in my head, and will change from past,present, or future from sentence to sentence. So, by all means fix it, if you like. I did another edit on the Teft page, but it wasn't for any reason other than clarity and condensation and to keep the same &quot;voice&quot; throughout the section. I'll let you do the final revision. I was just tweaking a bit. It wasn't done with any disrespect intended.</ins></div></td></tr>
