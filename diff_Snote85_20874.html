I don't know why but I kept assuming it would be turned into a 20 word paragraph and all the time I spent reading and re-reading would be wasted (Well more so than how time is wasted editing a wikipedia on a fictional setting and trying to summarize conjecture). I appreciate your time and efforts in helping me. The bad news is that now I've been reading Warbreaker and will have to start editing that info now!

(I'm just saying because you asked, and assume you want to know, not because I'm a grammar nazi.) I assume you mean no edit is permanent, but neither is it tossed away carelessly. Which is good to know. Thank you Joe and Meg, you two have been exceedingly nice to me. I appreciate your time.</ins></div></td></tr>
