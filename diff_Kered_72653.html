[[Lyn]] was chosen as a possible candidate to join the Windrunners. Lyn shares Skar's frustration about not being able to absorb stormlight. Instead of telling Lyn to not feel sorry for herself, he tells her the story of when Kaladin first absorbed stormlight. It was bridge run in which Bridge Four was a target for Parshendi arrows, and it was getting particular bloody. Skar was in the second row, the man in front of him stood beside Kaladin. The man in front of Skar fell and Skar knew for certainty that he would fall next as he was fully exposed then. Just as he was coming peace with dying, the arrows that were shot at him swerved and hit next to Kaladin instead. Kaladin had drawn the arrows towards himself unconsciously, thus saving Skar's life. Skar asks Lyn why she wants to be a Windrunner and she responds by saying she wants to soar. Skar tells her that is not good enough. he says that Kaladin wasn't thinking about flying or being left out when he first gained his powers. He was thinking about saving the Bridge Four, about saving Skar. He tells Lyn that she needs to make the most of the opportunity, to size a hold of it and try her best. If she doesn't and gives up instead, Skar tells her then she has no right to complain. As Lyn is contemplating Skar words, she sucks in stormlight. After she does this Skar muses if that's his lot, being a teacher or facilitator to people wanting to become Radiant's. Walking over to Rock, Skar asks him that since he probably will never become a Windrunner if he can help cook instead. While discussing this Rock notes that Skar is glowing. Skar has finally drawn in and absorbed stormlight becoming a full squire to Windrunners.{{book ref|sa3|46}}</div></td><td class='diff-marker'>&#160;</td><td class='diff-context'><div>While thinking on his future role in Bridge Four, Skar engages in a conversation with the scout, Lyn.
