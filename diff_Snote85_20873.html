I don't know why but I kept assuming it would be turned into a 20 word paragraph and all the time I spent reading and re-reading would be wasted (Well more so than how time is wasted editing a wikipedia on a fictional setting and trying to summarize conjecture). I appreciate your time and efforts in helping me. The bad news is that now I've been reading Warbreaker and will have to start editing that info now! (just kidding!)</ins></div></td></tr>
