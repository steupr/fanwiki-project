Bondsmiths also seem to be able to use this ability to give others access to some of their power, enabling (among other things) enhanced uses of other Radiants' powers. Dalinar was able to use this ability to draw all three realms much closer together than normal, pulling such a large amount of Investiture from the Spiritual Realm that he temporarily opened up a [[Perpendicularity]], and recharged all the gemstones in the immediate area with Stormlight. The effect of bringing the realms closer together also temporarily made Soulcasting much easier to do, with Jasnah being able to patch a massive hole in the Thalen City wall by transmuting air into a wall of solid bronze.</del></div></td><td colspan="2">&#160;</td></tr>
