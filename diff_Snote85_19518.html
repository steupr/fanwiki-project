I have the audiobook on my Iphone and listen to it basically everywhere I go, on repeat. Every time I seem to hear something new. I hope the small contributions I made were of help. I am really new to the editing of a wiki page. So, please feel free to add any hypertext links or correct my grammar as needed. I am not wanting to cause any problems to your wonderful resource here. I just thought a little more information on Honor would help understand the fight on Roshar. If there are any other pages you think could use some more info, I might have the knowledge to add a word or two, and the time to do so. I say this with the deepest respect to you, and your community here. It's not out of a sense of superiority, but out of a sense of almost duty. I want to help anyone emersed in this outstanding story to see connections I might have realized, that others haven't put together yet. Anyways, thanks for your time. keep me posted.</ins></div></td></tr>
