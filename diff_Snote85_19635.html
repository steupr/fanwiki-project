<tr><td colspan="2">&#160;</td><td class='diff-marker'>+</td><td class='diff-addedline'><div><ins class="diffchange">Thank you much for simplifying my wordiness on &quot;the highstorm and the dun spheres&quot; issue. I reread it like 300 times before finally walking away, and by that point I was too involved with it to notice the error. I knew what I was trying to convey, and my mind was telling me it was right. Even though now, after the fact, it is obvious your revision is much clearer and condensed compared to mine. Also, the events in the barrack after the storm were events that should have been included, so thank you for that addition as well. I do honestly appreciate it. I apologize for my grammatical crapitude. I have better intention than writing skill I'm afraid. So, by all means feel free to edit or change anything I might happen to edit in the future. I listen to the audiobook exclusively, so the spellings the book uses on a lot of things escapes me. I try to search the site for the reference, but don't always realize it's a different spelling, like &quot;dun&quot; for instance. I assumed it was &quot;done&quot; but had forgotten the term altogether when writing originally. So, long story short (something I'm not good at doing obviously, :P ) Thank you, very much! - Corey</ins></div></td></tr>
